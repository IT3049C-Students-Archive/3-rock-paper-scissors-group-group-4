## Team Reflection:
- Where did you encounter struggles today, and what did you do to deal with it?

We didn't encounter a big problem in the actual coding of the game, however our functions didn't work for some reason. Even though our functions worked in npm tests, it wasn't working when we actually tried to run the code on google chrome. It took us more than 3 hours to fix the problem. The problem was caused by the line of code we found in rock_paper_scissors.js which was autogenerated (we assume) becuase we didn't type that line in the first place. After we deleted that line, our game worked fine. 

This was the code that was causing problems. 
"const { lowerCase } = require("lodash");"

### How long it took us to finish this?
It took us about 6 hours.
